# Mini-Project-Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data

Method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. Examined data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves.
